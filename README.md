## Introduction
We are currently going through a difficult period of the pandemic. For our safety, many restrictions have been applied - for example, the limit of people who can enter the event (which is usually divided into vaccinated and unvaccinated) or to the store.

Covider is an iOS app that helps security guards count people. Thanks to it, their task will be easier - and they will never get confused about how many people have entered.

## Technologies
- SwiftUI 2.0
- Core Data
- MapKit
- CoreLocation

## Features
- Large buttons that cause haptic vibrations when pressed, preventing accidental and unnoticed tapping. Their size depends on that the security guards don't have much time to look for the button.
- Charts of people who have entered (divided down by hour).
- Maps with the place of service marked - it works only if the user allows the location services.
- iCloud data sync.
- Search bar hidden in the Navigation bar. Just swipe down, and it will appear immediately.
- Simple interface, with smooth and meaningful animations.
